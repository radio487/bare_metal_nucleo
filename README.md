# bare_metal_nucleo

This repository is a self learning exercise on the STM32L476RG microcontroller. The original idea was to use another microcontroller (STM32F103C8T6 bluepill) to gradually explore and modify the [libopencm3](https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3) codebase as an excuse to learn about the micro. Eventually, the decision to switch from the bluepill to a more feature rich one was taken. Moreover, most of the code ended up being written from scratch following the reference manual and the datasheet, although [libopencm3](https://github.com/libopencm3/libopencm3)-s influence can be clearly seen at places.
